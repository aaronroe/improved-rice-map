====================

Welcome to the interactive Rice map, brought to you by Rice Apps!

-------------------------------------------

Purpose
-------

This is an interactive and dynamic map of Rice's campus that
makes it easier for anyone to find where they need to go on 
Rice's campus. The intent is to make it easier for anyone 
on Rice campus to find where they need to go, find a place
to park, or even to find a professor's office. This map should
help you get to wherever you need to go.

Features
--------

The map is both interactive and dynamic, and has several features.
- The search bar at the top left of the screen should let you
search for buildings, professors, or parking lots.
- The button to the right of the search par that says Visitor Lots
shows you all of the currently open lots that you can park in at Rice
as a visitor.
- The button on the far top right will show your location so you can
figure out where you are in relation to where you need to go.
- The map tracks all Rice buses and updates them in real time.
- You can click on the names of certain places to access more information 
about the place, such as accessing the link to Fondren Library's website.
