Interactive Rice Map
====================

Welcome to the interactive Rice map, brought to you by Rice Apps!

-------------------------------------------

Rice Map's mission is to provide students at Rice with useful campus information such as building locations, classes, places to eat, parking, etc.

Team Members:
- Aaron Roe
- Grant Warren
- Waseem Ahmad
- John King

Currently, we are developing a platform-independent back-end that provides accurate campus data. 

The back-end will be implemented in Parse to minimize coding efforts and have access to native SDKs for Android, iOS, JavaScript, Unity and more.


General Use Cases We Hope to Support:
-User enters class name to get location of class
-User creates trip info for multiple-stop route
-User opens a link to a campus location
-User gets travel distance/time to campus location based on mode of transportation
-User gets approximate wait time for shuttle
-User shares link to campus location
-User searches upcoming/regular event on campus to find location
-User shares link to campus event location/time info
-User looks at the list of currently open places to eat on campus
-User follows link from eatery list to the website of a vendor
-User searches for currently open lots and their hours
-User searches sports schedule to find location and time of sporting event (e.g. IM Frisbee)
-User finds residential college, navigates to website from link
-User selects location and reserves room or space through Rice google calendar
-User creates publicly-visible event at location
-User sends location info for a reported incident to RUPD
